/**
 * `tongflow/canvas` — the React canvas.
 *
 * `FlowCanvas` renders TongFlow's node/edge components over the headless
 * flow store; `CanvasProvider` / `configureCanvasHost` point it at a
 * TongFlow-compatible API and set the locale; `canvasMessages` are the i18n
 * catalogs to merge into your `use-intl` provider. The hooks, API client and
 * UI primitives the canvas is built from are exported too so a host can
 * compose its own shell around it (the TongFlow app is the first such host).
 *
 * Peer requirements: react (18 or 19), react-dom, @xyflow/react, zustand,
 * use-intl; import `@xyflow/react/dist/style.css` and `tongflow/canvas.css`.
